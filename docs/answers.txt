   f4975e5..393589e  master -> master

b)There have been 9 commits in this repo so far, the command used is 
	git rev-list --count HEAD

c) the .gitignore file was last modified Wed Sep 25 18:13:30 2019. Command use:
	git log .gitignore

d) Two reasons that branches are used in git are 1) to keep a stable branch while
   debugging on another branch and 2) to allow for multiple people to work on one 
   project without effecting each other during development.

e) Git log shows use you a full history of your repo, while git status will only
   show the differences between the current dir and staging area.

f) You would use command:
	git log --follow Vehicle.h  

g) You would use command:
	git log --grep=file

h) I) Inheritance is when a subclass also has the atributes of its parent(s) class.
   II) Polymophism is when an object can take many forms, an example of this is the
       object class in python.
   III) Encapsulation is when data attributes are restricted to only the asscess that
	is needed, an example being public and private in C++  

I) The main differnece between these two workflows is that Integration manager handles
   pushes from all the devlopers, whereas the Lieutenants only work on the code from 
   some of the devlopers. 

J) It would be easier for multiple lieutenants to manage the code from 100 devlopers
   rather then having one person trying manage all 100 people.
